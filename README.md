# Python Based Iris Perceptron AI
- This project is written in Python 3.10 coding language.
-  This project is a hand coded (no sci-kit learn libraries used) implementation of the perceptron classifier.
-  Skills shown and used include a basic knowledge of Python functionality including:
  - - for loops
  - - Data Type interchanges
  - - variable creation, scope, and utilization
  - - class and method creation and utilization
  - - indexing knowledge and data manipulation
  - - Basic Machine Learning Algorithm Knowledge

## Libraries and Modules Used:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Cell by Cell Descriptions/Documentation:
- Cell 1:
  - - This cell imports the necessary libraries/extensions needed to build the AI
- Cell 2:
  - - This cell is where we create the AI's core function called the Perceptron
- Cell 3:
  - - This cell simply reads the data out of our .CSV file called iris.data. The output you see is the last 5 rows (tail) of the spreadsheet with some mild reformatting
- Cell 4:
  - - This cell creates our first plot of class labels (type of flower) and features (axis variables)
- Cell 5:
  - - This cell shows how quickly the AI learns or converges until it predicts things correctly. Epochs refers to the number of training rounds the AI goes through (epoch = n_iter)
- Cell 6:
  - - This cell shows how we plot the decision boundary (line) that separates Iris-setosa flower examples (red and squares, -1) from the Iris-versicolor flower examples (blue and X's, 1).
